Hello! I am Shane Koepfer, an electrical engineer with a passion for electronics and hardware design. 
Whether you are here from my resume or discovered me through other means, I would like to welcome you and thank you for taking the time to check out some of my projects.

This repository contains a few of my circuit and PCB designs that I have developed throughout my career so far. Each one of them contains a README file with a brief description of the circuit if you are interested.
If you have questions about any of them or would like to reach out to me directly, you can do so at ShaneKoepfer@gmail.com
